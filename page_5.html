          <h4>
            Removing makeup and cleansing the skin satisfies her need for
            regular cleanliness. The fact is that applying makeup or cosmetics
            without complete pre-cleansing is ineffective: the skin and its
            pores retain impurities, which contributes to the appearance of
            pimples and minor imperfections and accelerates its aging. In the
            morning, the skin also needs to get rid of traces of dust, sweat and
            night cream residue. For gentle gentle cleansing of the skin without
            compromising its balance, use gentle formulas and active ingredients
            suitable for your skin type.
