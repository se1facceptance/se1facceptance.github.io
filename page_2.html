          <h4>
            There are many different types of hair that require different
            specific care. Basic care begins with washing. And a competent
            approach to washing - from the choice of shampoo not according to
            the type of hair, but according to the type of scalp. So, dry skin
            will need a cleanser with a high concentration of oils. With
            increased fat content, light formulas with acids are preferable.
            Healthy and beautiful hair is entirely your merit. Yours - and
            effective care products. It is important to choose them correctly.
            Our brand will help you with this. Products for completely different
            hair types.
