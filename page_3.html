            Interestingly, the serum molecules are smaller than the cream
            molecules, their number is greater. That is why serums have the
            ability to penetrate deep into the skin, quickly absorbed by cells
            and solve any skin problems that even a good cream is sometimes
            powerless to face. It is no coincidence that serum is called a
            beauty concentrate.With increased pigmentation, freckles and uneven
            skin tone, a brightening serum is recommended. With excessive
            dryness and flaking of the skin, a moisturizing serum is required,
            which normalizes the water balance in the upper layers of the
            epidermis and eliminates skin tightness.
